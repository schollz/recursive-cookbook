Go out to your wheatfield and wait for stalks to turn from green to yellow or brown. The heads, heavy with grain, should tip toward the earth. This means it's time to test the grain. Choose a head, pick out a few grains, and pop them into your mouth. If they are soft and doughy, the grain is not yet ready. Keep testing. One day the grains will be firm and crunchy, and it will be time to harvest.

When you are ready to harvest, if you have a small enough plot, you can just snip the heads of wheat off the stems. It goes quickly if your wheat field is no larger than about 6 feet wide by 25 feet long. If you like the old-time way of doing things and are going to harvest a larger amount of grain, you might use a scythe and cradle. 

The next step is to bind the grain into sheaves, each about 12 to 14 inches in circumference a bunch you can hold comfortably in your hands. Bind the same day you cut the wheat. It's nice to have two people taking turns cutting and binding. You can bind with cord or baler's twine or even with some of the wheat stems, twisting them in a way that holds the bundle firm.

Stack the wheat sheaves upright in a well-ventilated, dry location safe from grain-eating animals. Our ancestors stacked sheaves to make shocks in the field, but with small quantities, it's easy to bring the sheaves in out of the weather. The grain has been cured when it is hard, shatters easily, and cannot be dented with your thumbnail.

Take your cured wheat and thresh the grain to separate the straw and chaff from it. You can go about this in any number of ways. One method is flailing. A flail consists of one piece of wood about 3 feet long the handle attached with a leather thong to a shorter piece about 2 feet long. The shorter piece is flung at the heads of grain repeatedly, shattering a few heads each time. If you are using this method, you can expect to produce about 3 pounds of wheat in 20 to 25 minutes. That's slow work. Also, there's a trick to learning to swing the tail without rapping yourself on the head.
Now you can winnow. The usual method for winnowing is pouring the grain from one container to another, letting either the wind or the breeze from an electric fan push the lighter chaff out of the grain. Repeat the process a few times to get the grain as chaff-free as possible until you have as many wheat berries as you need.

Plant winter wheat in fall to allow for six to eight weeks of growth before the soil freezes. This allows time for good root development. If the wheat is planted too early, it may smother itself the following spring and it could be vulnerable to some late-summer insects that won't be an issue in the cooler fall weather. If winter wheat is planted too late, it will not overwinter well.
Spring wheat should be planted as early as the ground can be worked in spring. Do the initial plowing in the fall, then till and sow in the spring. To ensure an evenly distributed crop, figure out the amount of seed you'll need, divide it into two piles, and broadcast one part in one direction, such as from east to west. Then broadcast the remainder from north to south. A cyclone crank seeder will do an even job, but broadcasting by hand is fine for a small plot. You also can plant it in rows like other crops.

Seeds should be grown outdoors, sow the seeds of wild oats at a depth of 6mm at the beginning to middle of spring.
Seedlings of wild oats can be purchased; annual varieties should be planted in the early spring, whereas perennial varieties can be planted either in the early spring or in autumn.
Depending on the variety wild oats seedlings should be planted 25 to 30cm apart (small) or 45 to 60cm apart (larger varieties of oat).
They should be planted in an area that receives full sunlight in a dry soil with a pH of 6 to 7.5.
Keep the ground moist to allow the seeds to germinate. Continue to do so as the plants begin to grow. The compost or manure should help the oats retain moisture, but it will be necessary to water them periodically whenever the soil begins to dry out. If the area you live in gets plenty of rain, however, you may not need to water your oats at all.
Harvest by swathing, cutting the plants at about 10 cm (4 inches) above ground, and putting the swathed plants into windrows with the grain all oriented the same way. They leave the windrows to dry in the sun for several days before combining them using a pickup header. Finally, bale the straw.
Oats can also be left standing until completely ripe and then combined with a grain head. This will lead to greater field losses as the grain falls from the heads and to harvesting losses as the grain is threshed out by the reel. Without a draper head, there will also be somewhat more age to the straw since it will not be properly oriented as it enters the throat of the combine. Overall yield loss is 10-15% compared to proper swathing.
Historical harvest methods involved cutting with a scythe or sickle, and threshing under the feet of cattle. Late 19th and early 20th century harvesting was performed using a binder. Oats were gathered into shocks and then collected and run through a stationary threshing machine.

Stir to homogenize the milk, and slowly fold in the diluted rennet. Using an up-and-down motion with your spoon will ensure that the rennet works its way through all the milk, so you can get the highest possible yield.
Allow the cheese to set for 1 hour, or until the whey begins to separate from the curd. You should see a layer of mostly clear whey floating on top of the curd, and the curd should be pulling away from the sides of the pot.
Using the knife, carefully cut the curds into ¼-inch cubes and allow to set for 5 minutes. Do not stir.
Over the next 30 minutes, slowly heat the curds to 100°F, stirring frequently. As you stir, the curds will shrink.
Once the curds are at 100°F, maintain the temperature and continue stirring for the next 30 minutes. If the curds get too hot, remove from heat.
After 30 minutes, stop stirring and allow the curds to settle to the bottom of the pot. This will take about 20 minutes.
Pour the curds into a colander. Place the colander and curds back into the cheese pot and allow to drain for 15 minutes.
Remove the colander from the pot and turn the curds out onto a cutting board. You should have a semi-solid mass that looks like jelly. Pour the whey out of the pot, cut the mass into five slices, and place back into the pot. Cover.
Fill a sink or basin with 102°F water and place the pot and curds into it. Keeping the temperature of the curds right around 100°F, turn the slices every 15 minutes for the next 2 hours. This is the cheddaring process and will give your cheese its unique flavor and deliciousness.

Once you have cooled and possibly pasteurized your milk, you can skim the cream off for butter or other dairy creations. To do this, you can let your milk stand in the refrigerator for several hours and skim the cream layer off with a ladle, or you can purchase a cream separator.

Let your seawater sit for a while to allow any sediment and particles to settle.
Get your stockpot out and ready for the boil. 
Then siphon or scoop water from the top of the container, careful not to disturb the sediment at the bottom, through a filter into your stockpot.
Use a dishcloth in a sieve for a filter, which provides a good fine mesh to get out any sand or other particles.
Start off with a full boil at high heat, until about half of the water had evaporated. 
Then turn the burner down to the medium-high heat.
As the water evaporates, turn the heat lower and lower until down to medium-low.

Kill the pig humanely. Whether you're harvesting a farm-raised hog or hunting one in the wild, you need to make sure you start the process as clean as possible by using a quick kill, immediately draining the blood afterward to improve the flavor of the meat.
After killing or stunning the hog, you need to hang it, preferably using a meat gambrel, which is like a big clothes hanger made for hanging meat. Hook a chain onto the gambrel and attach it to a winch, or the back of a truck if you want.
Scrape the hair off using a sharp knife.
Cut around the anus and pull it upward. To start removing the entrails, work a smaller knife around the anus (and the vaginal opening) of the hog, about an inch or two deep. Make the circle about two inches wider than the anus itself so you don't pierce the colon. Grab ahold and pull up gently, then use a rubber band or a zip-tie to pinch it off. This closes everything up, so you'll be able to pull it out the other side, when you open up the chest. 
Cut from the sternum to the groin. Pinch the skin near the base of the sternum, where the ribs end and the abdomen begins, and pull toward you as far as possible. Insert your knife and gently work your way down the center line of the pig's belly, in between the two rows of nipples. Be extremely careful not to puncture the stomach lining and the intestines. Keep working your knife until you get all the way up between the animal's legs.
Reach into the cavity near the groin and pull downward. Everything in the digestive tract should fall out relatively easily with a bit of coaxing, including the lower intestine that you tied off earlier. Use you knife to trim away any stubborn connective tissue The kidneys and the pancreas are perfectly edible and popular items to reserve.
After the entrails are removed, you need to open up the chest to remove the rest of the organs. You can use your knife to separate the front of the rib cage, working your way in between the layer of cartilage that connects the breastbone. You shouldn't have to use the saw to do this. After separating the ribs, remove the rest of the organs. The heart and liver and commonly reserved and eaten.
Behind the ears, work your knife in a circular direction around the throat to separate the head, using the jawline as a guide. As you separate the meat and expose the neck bone, you might need to get in there with a cleaver to break through the vertebrae with firm chop.
Chill the carcass for at least 24 hours before breaking it down. To dry out the meat some, the hog will need to be aged for about a day in cold temperature, between 30 and 40 degrees F. A walk-in fridge is the easiest way to do this, or processing your hot during a very cold season, in which you'll be able to do it in a shed or garage.
Remove the hams. Lay one half cut-side up, and find where the spine ends, near the fleshy part of the thigh (that's the ham) on that side. Start with a sharp boning knife to expose the ham.
Remove the shoulder. To remove the shoulder, flip the side of pork over so the skin side is facing up. Pull the limb up, exposing the underarm of the shoulder, and work your knife into the connective tissue underneath. You'll only have to use your knife to continue working toward the joint, which should pull away easily by pulling it back on itself.
Remove the chops and tenderloin. Flip the side over again, cut-side up. From the smallest rib at the narrow end of the side, count up to the third or fourth rib and use the cleaver to cut through the backbone at that point, between the ribs. Remove everything below that line and reserve the meat for the grinder, or discard it. If you've got an electric butcher's saw, this is much easier.
Separate the bacon. The lower, thinner section of the side contains everyone's favorite pork: the ribs and the bacon. It's best to separate the bacon, first. It's just below where the ribs end, and should appear to be quite fatty.
Bone out the neck and grind up some sausage. The only remaining meat is usually best reserved for grinding up into sausage. If you have access to a meat grinder, you can grind pork to make sausage or basic ground pork. It's usually best to re-chill the meat before feeding it into the grinder, since cooler meat tends to grind up more uniformly.
Store the meat properly. As soon as you portioned out the pork, it's important that you wrap it neatly in clean butcher paper, label it with the cut and date using a marker. You can refrigerate the meat you plan on using right away and find freezer space for the rest of it. There's going to be a lot of meat to deal with, so it's usually more common to freeze most of it immediately.

Now spread the paste obtained from the previous step over circular mats and subject it to pressing. At this point, juice will flow out of the paste, leaving behind what is known as 'pomace'.

Spread the compost over an area roughly 9 feet (2.7 m) by 9 feet (2.7 m) to avoid over-concentration in one spot.
Bring up your soil's pH to an acceptable level with the addition of lime. If your soil's pH is below 6.5, consider adding lime to the soil to boost its alkalinity. Talk to your Department of Agriculture representative or contact a local fertilizer company if you want specific pH readings and/or pointers on how to get a uniform pH of 6.5.
Deep-rip your soil at least 2 feet (0.6 m) deep and 10 feet (3.0 m) wide across each planting row. Deep ripping increases soil drainage and eases compaction, giving your olive trees an excellent start and the possibility of speedy growth.
Plant the olive tree in full sun, outdoors, at the same level that it was in the pot. Ideally, plant in April or May when frost is not likely to harm the tree.
Water and irrigate your olive tree modestly or as necessary. 
Pruning should occur between the end of winter and flowering. Although not all trees need to be pruned every year, proper pruning will result in a tree with balanced vigor and better fruit. Removing unwanted branches and suckers can keep the tree at a manageable height for easier harvesting and prevent uneven bearing of fruit. Check diligently for pests and other diseases. Like most plants, the olive tree is sometimes susceptible to attack, particularly from black scale, or Saissetia oleae. 
While some cultivars begin bearing fruit as soon as two or three years if properly maintained, many trees won't start bearing until 10 years old. Dry-farmed trees may not bear until they are 20 or 30 years old.
Olives start out green and eventually all turn black as they ripen. Olives that are harvested when they are still green have a peppery, grassy, or more herbaceous flavor, while olives that are harvested when they turn taker have a milder, buttery flavor. Many oils are a mix between green and ripe olives, harvested right when they are turning color.
Harvest ripe or unripe fruits by hitting the branches with a long stick. Spread a net on the ground before hitting so that olives fall directly on it.
