# Formatting

Recipes are collections of ingredients. There are two types of ingredients: *compound* and *fundamental*. Most ingredients are *compound* ingredients. All *compound* ingredients are defined by the ingredients they have and the operations on them to create the new ingredieint. The *fundamental* ingredients can not have sub-ingredients or operations, as they are fundamental.

Mix statements are redundant
