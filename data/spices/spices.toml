description="Homemade Vanilla Extract is prized for its rich, complex flavor and incredibly smooth aroma. "
ingredients = """
3 to 5 vanilla beans
8 ounces alcohol
"""
directions = """
Split each vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Place the vanilla beans in a clean jar or bottle. Cover them with alcohol, making sure they are completely submerged. Cover the jar or bottle and give it a good shake.
Store the jar or bottle of vanilla beans in a cool, dark place for at least one month, shaking it from time to time. Taste the extract and let it infuse longer if you want a stronger flavor. 
You may wish to remove the vanilla pods and decant the extract into a pretty bottle. The little flecks of seeds can be a nice touch, but if you want a clear extract you can strain them out using a coffee filter.
