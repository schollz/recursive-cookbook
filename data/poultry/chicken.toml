Place the chicken upside down in a kill cone. Using a sharp knife, slit the artery in the throat (which runs right on the backside of the earlobe) and allow the blood to drain out and the chicken to die  this usually takes around 30 seconds to 1 minute. Give it more pressure than you think youll need  getting the knife through the feathers can be tough and multiple attempts and cuts is not desirable for anyone involved. Once the chicken is dead, remove its body from the kill cone.
Gently dip the chicken into a large pot of 145-150 degree water for 3 seconds, shaking it gently while its submerged. Pull the chicken from the water for 3 seconds. Dunk it again in the hot water for 3 seconds, shaking it gently. Again, pull the chicken out of the water for a few seconds. Grab a feather from the bird and pull it out. Does it slip out easily without resistance? If yes, proceed to the next step. If not, continue to dunk the bird for 3 seconds at a time until the feathers pull out like warm butter.
Once the chicken has been scalded, begin plucking the feathers by hand. Then transfer the chicken to the evisceration station where the head, feet, and guts will be removed.
Remove the feet. Halfway up their legs theres a joint that connects the leg to the foot  cut right in the middle of the joint and the feet will easily be removed. I use a filet knife for this and it works just fine. Next, remove the head. This you may need a pair of pruners for  it can be a bit tricky to remove. Once the neck bone is broken though its easy enough to cut through the remaining skin. Save these parts for homemade chicken stock. 
Flip the chicken over so its breast side up. At the narrow end of the breast, grab the skin with one hand and use your other hand to cut a slit in the skin. Get all your fingers in there and use your hands to gently pull open the body cavity, revealing the innards.
Once you can see the innards, its easy to reach in with one hand and pull out all of the guts. Using your fingers, its nearly impossible to rupture the intestines, but be careful none-the-less. Its important that no poo gets onto the meat as this will contaminate it. Pull.
At this point, youll likely notice that there is a long straw-like thing at the top of the bird thats keeping you from removing the guts completely. Thats the windpipe. Reach in there and wrap your fingers around it and pull hard. There should be nothing left in the body cavity when youre finished.
Take a sharp filet knife and gently cut a v shape around the vent of the chicken. BE CAREFUL to not puncture the intestines or the vent. Just cut around it and remove it completely.
Place the chicken into a large bucket filled with ice and let it remain there while you finish harvesting the rest of the birds.
Once all the birds are cleaned, take them inside to wash them out and do quality control. Any stray parts left in the body cavity are removed, leftover feathers are plucked, the entire chicken is rinsed with water (both inside and out) and all of the chickens are placed into individual shrink wrap bags, along with the head, the feet, and any other bits we will keep.
Place the chickens, in their open shrink wrap bags, into the refrigerator for 1-2 days. This will allow the chickens to air-chill  an incredibly important step in the process. Without this, the chicken tends to be stiff and chewy. During the air-chilling, the meat has a chance to rest and relax, resulting in a much more tender bird.
After the air-chilling period, shrink wrap the chicken (according to the bags instructions) and place in the freezer for storage.
