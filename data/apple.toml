Spring planting is recommended in central and northern areas. Where fall and winter weather is generally mild and moist, fall planting is successful. 
Find a sunny spot with well-drained soil that is not too wet. Remove all weeds and grass in 4-foot diameter circle. Dig a hole and place the seeds.
Wait about 6 years for the tree to grow.
Then harvest the apples by picking them off the tree.
