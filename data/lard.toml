Preheat oven to 250F. Cut the pork belly into chunks. Place the chunks into a deep skillet or dutch oven with a cup of water. 
Place the pot in the oven and let the fat melt for 6 hours.
Take the pot out and ladle the liquid into a cheesecloth-lined sieve over a large bowl. Extract liquid and then return the smaller pieces of fat back to the oven for a few more hours.
Remove the pot again and pour the rest of the contents into the sieve.
