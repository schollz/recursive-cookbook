Build a bee-hive, for example [see this](http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Honey-Bee-Box).
Catch a wild spring swarm of bees (a cluster of bees that have left their hive and are temporarily hanging from a tree or bush), or get bees shipped to you.
Place the bees in the bee hive and make sure there are flowers in the surrounding area.

Burn some plants or wood to make smoke. (Pine needles are generally good for this purpose.) 
Put the smoking material into a container you can carry, and take it over to the hive. Waft the smoke into the hole. Smoke makes the bees expect a fire, which makes them concerned about their honey. They gorge themselves over the uncapped honey, which makes them less likely to fly around and sting you. 
Working slowly and carefully, cut a piece of the honeycomb with a sharp knife. Try to avoid getting comb that contains larvae. Don't try to take the whole hive, just take a piece. 
Spin the honey comb or pour it into a container.
