ingredients = """
1/4 c. salt
1/2 c. brown sugar
1/3 c. pepper
2-pound slab of pork belly
"""
directions = """
Mix the salt, sugar and pepper in a bowl. Rub the mixture over the pork belly. Cover and set it in the refrigerator for 7 days, turning it every other day to ensure the pork is covered in the cure.
Remove the pork from the refrigerator and rinse it well. Pat it dry and place it on a cooling rack over a baking sheet in the refrigerator and air-dry for 2 days.
Smoke the bacon until the thickest part of the meat reaches 140F. You can use a smoker, a kettle grill, or a large pot on the stove top.
After smoking, cool for a few minutes and then ease off the skin with a large knife.
Cool to room temperature and then wrap and chill until it is firm. Slice to eat.
