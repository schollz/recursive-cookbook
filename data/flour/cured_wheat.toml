When the wheat grains are firm and crunchy, it is time to harvest.
To harvest, just snip off the heads of the wheat from the stems.
The next step is to bind the grain into sheaves, each about 12 to 14 inches in circumference, a bunch you can hold comfortably in your hands. Bind the same day you cut the wheat.
Stack the sheaves upright in a well-ventilated, dry location safe from grain-eating animals. The grain has been cured when it is hard, shatters easily, and cannot be dented with your thumbnail.
