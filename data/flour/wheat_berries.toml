Take the cured wheat and thresh it to separate the straw from the chaff. You can do this using a flail composed of a piece of wood about 3 feet long with a handle attached that has a leather thong tied to a shorter piece about 2 feet long. The shorter piece is flung at the heads of grain constantly, shattering a few heads each time. It takes about 30 minutes for 3 pounds of wheat berries.
