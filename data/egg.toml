Create a coop for the chickens. Make sure it has plenty of shelter and possibly a place to roost.
Make sure chickens always have access to chicken feed (seed, egg shells) and water.
Give them a fence and possibly a net to protect from predators.
Provide an area for them to dig/scratch and run around.
After 6 months the chickens will start laying an egg every few days
